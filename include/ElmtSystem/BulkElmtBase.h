/**
 * This abstract class defines the basic calculation of the local elmenent.
 * It should be noted that, this calculation is focusing on single 
 * quadrature point.<br>
 * For example, the residual looks like:\f$\int_{\Omega}\nabla c\nabla N^{I}dV\f$, the bulk 
 * element only calculate the \f$\nabla c\nabla N^{I}\f$ part.
